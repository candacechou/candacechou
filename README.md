- 👋 Hi, I’m @candacechou, robotics engineer focusing on computer vision and decision making.
- 👀 I’m interested in ML/DL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision and robotics. It is a whole life learning path. But currently thinking about putting web application 
     into my must-learn list becase recommendation system sounds fun, isn't it ?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool side project on machine learning and algorithm, preferably with recommendation system, any idea?
- 📫 How to reach me: send email to me : chchou@kth.se
